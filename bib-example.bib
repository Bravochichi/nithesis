 abstract={The paper describes an economic alternative to the conventional design of a hydro power station which feeds power into a hvdc transmission line. A methodology is developed to operate hydraulic turbines under variable speed to maximize the turbine efficiency taking the loading and water head conditions into account. A 10x100 MW unit connected hydro power station is analyzed. A 500 MW unit connection scheme which represents one pole of the above station is simulated in time domain using Electro-Magnetic Transient Program (EMTDC). The harmonic currents flowing in stator and rotor circuits of the generator are computed and its derating factors at 60 Hz and 70 Hz operation are evaluated. Economic evaluation has been performed for 10x100 MW hydrostation for both conventional and unit connection configurations. Savings achieved by adopting unit connection scheme are presented.},

 abstract={There is provided a turbine for a hydroelectric power installation. The turbine has a rotor with a plurality of blades, with the rotor being arranged in front of a guide apparatus (in the flow direction). The pitch angle of the blades of the rotor is adapted to be variable. As the rotor is arranged in front of the guide apparatus (in the flow direction) the flow meets the rotor first and only thereafter meets the guide apparatus, thus affording optimum flow conditions for the rotor.},
