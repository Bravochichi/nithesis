\par First, the definition, significance, research emphases and status of NC machining verification technology are introduced in this paper. Then the platformâ€”ACIS for the development of verification system, including its development interface, data structure, main functions, features and the application in the system is introduced. And, we indicate in brief the correlative knowledge of NC machining and then discuss the definition of the machining environment of NC machining verification system as well as the way that the module has been developed. Finally, we describe how to make Help Files and the structure of the Help Files in the system.
